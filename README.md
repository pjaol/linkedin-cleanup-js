# LinkedIn Feed Cleanup Script

This script removes posts containing "Suggested" from your LinkedIn feed to provide a cleaner browsing experience. It works on infinite scroll pages without disrupting the site's functionality.

## How to Install the Script

To use this script, you'll need to install a browser extension called **Tampermonkey** (for Chrome, Firefox, or other browsers) or **Greasemonkey** (for Firefox). Once installed, you can add this custom user script to your browser.

### Step 1: Install Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey

#### For Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge:
1. Go to the [Tampermonkey website](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).
2. Choose the version for your browser and click "Install".
3. Follow the instructions to complete the installation.

#### For Firefox:
1. Go to the [Greasemonkey Add-on page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/).
2. Click "Add to Firefox" and follow the steps to install it.

### Step 2: Install the LinkedIn Feed Cleanup Script

1. After you’ve installed Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey, click this link to install the script:
   [Install LinkedIn Cleanup Script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pjaol/linkedin-cleanup-js/main/clean-up-linkedin-feed.user.js)
   
2. You’ll be redirected to a page that shows the script. In Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey, click the **Install** button to add it to your browser.

### Step 3: Start Browsing LinkedIn

Once the script is installed, it will automatically clean up "Suggested" posts from your LinkedIn feed as you scroll. The cleanup happens in the background and will hide posts containing the word "Suggested" without affecting the rest of your feed.

### Troubleshooting

- If the script is not working as expected, make sure that Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey is enabled and that the script is installed.
- If LinkedIn changes its layout, the script may stop working. You can always check for updates by visiting this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pjaol/linkedin-cleanup-js) for the latest version of the script.
