# LinkedIn Feed Cleanup Script

This script removes "Suggested" posts from your LinkedIn feed to provide a cleaner browsing experience.

If the suggested posts were any good, we won't need this. 
And sometimes we just need to take back the websites we use.

Already have GreaseMonkey or TamperMonkey then [Install LinkedIn Cleanup Script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pjaol/linkedin-cleanup-js/main/clean-up-linkedin-feed.user.js)

Go to linkedin and voila no more suggested feeds.

## Privacy
NO DATA IS COLLECTED, TRANSMITTED, STORED.
The script runs in your browser and just hides crappy updates in your feed

## How to Install the Script

To use this script, you'll need to install a browser extension called **Tampermonkey** (for Chrome, Firefox, or other browsers) or **Greasemonkey** (for Firefox). Once installed, you can add this custom user script to your browser.

### Step 1: Install Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey

#### For Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge:
1. Go to the [Tampermonkey website](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).
2. Choose the version for your browser and click "Install".
3. Follow the instructions to complete the installation.

#### For Firefox:
1. Go to the [Greasemonkey Add-on page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/).
2. Click "Add to Firefox" and follow the steps to install it.


### Step 2: Install the LinkedIn Feed Cleanup Script

1. After you’ve installed Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey, click this link to install the script:
   [Install LinkedIn Cleanup Script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pjaol/linkedin-cleanup-js/main/clean-up-linkedin-feed.user.js)
   
2. You’ll be redirected to a page that shows the script. In Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey, click the **Install** button to add it to your browser.

### Step 3: Start Browsing LinkedIn

Once the script is installed, it will automatically clean up "Suggested" posts from your LinkedIn feed as you scroll. The cleanup happens in the background and will hide posts containing the word "Suggested" without affecting the rest of your feed.

### Troubleshooting

- If the script is not working as expected, make sure that Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey is enabled and that the script is installed.
- If LinkedIn changes its layout, the script may stop working. The please let me know via the issues tab above or sending a quick mail to hello :email: thevgergroup.com
- You can always check for updates by visiting this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pjaol/linkedin-cleanup-js) for the latest version of the script.
